# Ben Krieger - Atlanta, GA

I am a software developer and architect with a strong background in PKI,
cryptography, and mobile technology networking (LTE/5G). I have designed and
implemented systems with unusually high security requirements that run in the
mobile cores of cellular carriers. I have recently shifted my focus to
defining new architecture of a mobile edge computing platform as the architect
reporting to the chief architect in a fast-growing startup.

## Experience

### Software Architect (Smart-Edge.com, Inc)

June 2018 - Present

* Architected a solution to bypass kernel networking functions to obtain the
  necessary throughput for 5G user data processing (e.g. network breakout, DPI)
* Designed an online software licensing system leveraging cryptography and the
  current PKI infrastructure to protect against bad actors

### Platform Engineer (Applied Computer Solutions)

September 2016 - May 2018

* Transitioned a microservice architecture platform from a centralized
  messaging system (RabbitMQ) to distributed (gRPC) to meet scaling needs
* Implemented an API-driven PKI management system with many intermediate
  certificate authorities to ensure a secure-at-every-level system that
  leverages TLS, short-lived certificates, and online revocation checking
* Implemented a custom service director and distributed consensus key-value
  storage system to incorporate role-based authorization to limit the access of
  each microservice

### IT Software Engineer (TRADOC Analysis Center - WSMR)

July 2013 - August 2016

* Developed a custom DISA-compliant Git server and authentication layer with
  automated porting from SVN
