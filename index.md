# Ben Krieger

My dream is to build a programming language and community one day and to become a cicerone. I find jumping into problems completely different from what I have seen before especially thrilling (preferably with people I trust). Software and all the fun that goes along with it comes from solving hard problems as a team.

## Code Samples

### Dependency-free Sass build system for Sublime Text

* But it really depends on the problem. Idiomatic/elegant code is like good music. When it is good, it is good and the genre is not meaningful.
* That being said, Vim > Emacs
